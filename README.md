<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong>&nbsp;(AI) is the ability of a&nbsp;<a title="Computer program" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">computer program</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a title="Machine" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine">machine</a>&nbsp;to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". They work on their own without being encoded with commands.<a title="John McCarthy" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy">John McCarthy</a>&nbsp;came up with the name "artificial intelligence" in 1955.</p>
<p>In general use, the term "artificial intelligence" means a programme which mimics human&nbsp;<a title="Cognition" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognition</a>. At least some of the things we associate with other minds, such as&nbsp;<a title="Learning" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning">learning</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Problem solving" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem solving</a>&nbsp;can be done by computers, though not in the same way as we do.<sup id="cite_ref-RN_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-RN-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;<a title="Andreas Kaplan" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Kaplan">Andreas Kaplan</a>&nbsp;and Michael Haenlein define AI as a system&rsquo;s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.</p>
<p>An ideal (perfect) intelligent machine is a flexible agent which&nbsp;<a title="Perception" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception">perceives</a>&nbsp;its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of success at some goal or objective. As machines become increasingly capable, mental faculties once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example,&nbsp;<a title="Optical character recognition" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">optical character recognition</a>&nbsp;is no longer perceived as an exemplar of "artificial intelligence": it is just a routine technology.</p>
<p>At present we use the term AI for successfully&nbsp;<a title="Natural language processing" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">understanding human speech</a>,&nbsp;competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as&nbsp;<a title="Chess" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Go (game)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>),&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Self-driving cars" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_cars">self-driving cars</a>, and interpreting complex data.&nbsp;Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it continues to progress at its current pace.</p>
<p>An extreme goal of AI research is to create computer programs that can&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Learn" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learn">learn</a>, solve problems, and think logically.&nbsp;In practice, however, most applications have picked on problems which computers can do well. Searching data bases and doing calculations are things computers do better than people. On the other hand, "perceiving its environment" in any real sense is way beyond present-day computing.</p>
<p>AI involves many different fields like&nbsp;<a title="Computer science" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Mathematics" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Linguistics" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">linguistics</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Psychology" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Neuroscience" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">neuroscience</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Philosophy" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a>. Eventually researchers hope to create a "general artificial intelligence" which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one. Researchers are also trying to create creative and emotional AI which can possibly empathize or create art. Many approaches and tools have been tried.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the&nbsp;<a title="Management" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management">management</a>&nbsp;literature,&nbsp;<a title="Andreas Kaplan" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Kaplan">Kaplan</a>&nbsp;and Haenlein classify artificial intelligence into three different types of AI systems: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with&nbsp;<a title="Cognition" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognitive intelligence</a>&nbsp;generating cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions. Human-inspired AI has elements from cognitive as well as&nbsp;<a title="Emotional intelligence" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>, understanding, in addition to cognitive elements, also human emotions considering them in their&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Decision making" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making">decision making</a>. Humanized AI shows characteristics of all types of competencies (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence), able to be self-conscious and self-aware in interactions with others.</p>

<h2><span id="History" class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The first appearance of artificial intelligence is in Greek myths, like&nbsp;<a title="Talos" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos">Talos</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Crete" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete">Crete</a>&nbsp;or the bronze robot of&nbsp;<a title="Hephaestus" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Humanoid" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid">Humanoid</a>&nbsp;robots were built by&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Yan Shi (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yan_Shi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yan Shi</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Hero of Alexandria" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria">Hero of Alexandria</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Al-Jazari" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jazari">Al-Jazari</a>. Sentient machines became popular in fiction during the 19th and 20th centuries with the stories of&nbsp;<em><a title="Frankenstein" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a class="new" title="R.U.R. (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R.U.R.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Rossum's Universal Robots</a></em>.</p>
<p><a class="new" title="Formal logic (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Formal_logic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Formal logic</a>&nbsp;was developed by ancient Greek philosophers and mathematicians. This study of logic produced the idea of a&nbsp;<a title="Computer" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>&nbsp;in the 19th and 20th century. Mathematician&nbsp;<a title="Alan Turing" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing's</a>&nbsp;<a title="Theory of computation" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">theory of computation</a>&nbsp;said that any mathematical problem could be solved by processing 1's and 0's. Advances in&nbsp;<a title="Neurology" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology">neurology</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Information theory" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Cybernetics" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cybernetics</a>&nbsp;convinced a small group of researchers that an electronic brain was possible.</p>
<p>AI research really started with a conference at&nbsp;<a title="Dartmouth College" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College">Dartmouth College</a>&nbsp;in 1956. It was a month long&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Brainstorming (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brainstorming&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">brainstorming</a>&nbsp;session attended by many people with interests in AI. At the conference they wrote programs that were amazing at the time, beating people at checkers or solving word problems. The&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Department of Defense" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense">Department of Defense</a>&nbsp;started giving a lot of money to AI research and labs were created all over the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, researchers really underestimated just how hard some problems were. The tools they had used still did not give computers things like&nbsp;<a title="Emotion" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">emotions</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Common sense" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense">common sense</a>. Mathematician&nbsp;<a class="new" title="James Lighthill (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Lighthill&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">James Lighthill</a>&nbsp;wrote a report on AI saying that "in no part of the field have discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised".&nbsp;The U.S and British governments wanted to fund more productive projects. Funding for AI research was cut, starting an "<a class="new" title="AI winter (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AI_winter&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">AI winter</a>" where little research was done.</p>
<p>AI research revived in the 1980s because of the popularity of&nbsp;<a title="Expert system" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">expert systems</a>, which simulated the knowledge of a human expert. By 1985, 1 billion dollars were spent on AI. New, faster computers convinced U.S. and British governments to start funding AI research again. However, the market for&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Lisp Machine (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lisp_Machine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Lisp machines</a>&nbsp;collapsed in 1987 and funding was pulled again, starting an even longer AI winter.</p>
<p>AI revived again in the 90s and early 2000s with its use in&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a>&nbsp;and medical diagnosis. This was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems. In 1997,&nbsp;<a class="new" title="IBM Deep Blue (not yet started)" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Deep_Blue&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Deep Blue</a>&nbsp;became the first computer program to beat&nbsp;<a title="Chess" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">chess</a>&nbsp;world champion&nbsp;<a title="Garry Kasparov" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>.
